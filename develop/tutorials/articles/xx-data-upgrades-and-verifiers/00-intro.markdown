# Data Upgrades and Verifiers [](id=data-upgrades-and-verifiers)

Your app goes through various stages of development. You add new features,
remove features, improve features, reorganize the code, etc. During the cycle of
development, you'll want to upgrade your app to a new version to indicate to
your end users that improvements have been made. Liferay provides a robust 
upgrade framework for you to use. As changes are being made to the database with
your app you'll want to to verify and fix any integrity problems found in the 
database. Liferay also provides a robust verifier framework for you to use. 

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn how to create an upgrade process for 
your app, how to migrate your existing upgrade processes to use the new upgrade 
framework, and how to create a verification process for your app.
